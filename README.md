# AI-Desktop-Voice-Assistant---Python
I developed an AI-powered Desktop Voice Assistant using Python, designed to perform tasks and respond to user commands through voice interaction. The project leverages the speech_recognition library to process and understand user input, while pyttsx3 enables the assistant to generate human-like voice responses. I integrated the wikipedia module to allow the assistant to fetch and summarize information directly from Wikipedia, providing quick and reliable knowledge-based answers. Additionally, I used the webbrowser module to open and navigate websites based on user requests, making the assistant practical for day-to-day tasks such as searching the web, retrieving information, and automating simple activities. This project not only strengthened my skills in Python programming, natural language processing, and API integration but also gave me hands-on experience in building intelligent, interactive applications that bridge human-computer interaction.
